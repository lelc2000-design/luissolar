Luís Solar — Fresh

Minimal Vite + React app created to replace previous workspace.

Quick commands:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Luis888\Desktop\luissolar-fresh
npm install
npm run dev   # start dev server
npm run build # produce production build in dist/
``` 

I can push this to your GitHub and deploy to Vercel if you confirm.
